***note*** : The coverage badge is only checking the ImageCropper code at the moment.
  
 Travis CI is currently not building because of some issues in the requirements file which have yet to be rectified. 
 
 There are two build status badges because I accidently setup a Travis-CI.com account first instead of a Travis-CI.org account. (They should both be the same, just including both for sake of completeness).
  
Repository for the parking space app by the Wits Designers. 

The project is still in early devolpment. 

Add any notes that are needed in this read me.
